# **FlappyGrad**
FlappyGrad is a variation of FlappyBird where you solve math problems in addition to jumping through pipes. This project was started as a submission for the WWDC 2020 Student Challenge and as a way for me to learn more about Swift.

## Storyline
You will play as a senior little bird who is in their last semester of college when corona breaks out. Now, classes are no longer in-person and must be made remote. As such, your courses will now be much different, so much that the credits you get from them are now called Zoom credits. You must now finish all of your final exams, represented as mere elementary math, so that you can rack up Zoom credits and graduate college with a degree. Luckily, you now have the ability to transfer Zoom credits easily to get higher level degrees. Will you manage to graduate before the effects of corona catch up to you (health, health preparation, laziness, poor organization)?

Below is a graphic of the number of Zoom credits you will need to graduate with each type of degree (remember that you started off as a last-semester senior):

## How to Play



## Graphics
All assets in this game were created by me using **krita**
I wanted to honor the original flappy bird so I created all assets with pixelart ranging from 10x10 to 60x60 pixelart.
